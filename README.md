# Demo Joel Ngalamulume

This is my programming demo .

## Getting Started

Instructions to set up and run the project.

## Accessing the H2 Database

I have created an in memmory database using h2 and i have packed this with the project .
Once you have pulled(downloaded) the project, please run the project two or three times in order
to see the output with the data saved in the database. Those data are the same with the one provided in the example in the pdf file(challenge file) .
After executing this, you will see the output in the console for each test case as given in the challenge file .

Test cases are written in the rentalServiceTest file and there is only two methods tested as you can see in that file .


Thanks
